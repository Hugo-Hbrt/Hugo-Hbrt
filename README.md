## Passionate Software Engineer

**Curiosity & Creativity** — These two words best describe my approach to software development.

## 💡About Me

I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity that pushes me to explore new tools and technologies. Today, I'm proud to harness the power of AI tools that are revolutionizing software engineering — but with a thoughtful approach.

Don't get me wrong: I strongly oppose the "vibe-coding" trend. **True leverage of AI requires solid engineering fundamentals.** That's why I'm deeply committed to:
- **Clean Code Principles**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

I'm continuously learning and refining my craft to become the best software engineer I can be.

### Curious.
I thrive on learning new things and discovering better ways to work. My process: **learn → test → fail → retry → grow**. Routine? Not for me.

### Creative.
Art runs in my family. My grandmother and mother were both masterchefs with a deep love for art, and I've inherited that fascination with beauty and craftsmanship.
As a self-proclaimed nerd, my canvas is code. I find joy in discovering elegant solutions to complex problems and exploring multiple approaches until I find the perfect one.

## 💼 Professional Journey

### The Beginning
My software development journey started with coding games in Python and Unity — igniting a passion that would shape my career.

### Education
Graduated with an **Engineering Master's Degree from ESTACA**. As I've always been passionate about motorsport and automotive (thanks dad).

### R&D Algorithm Software Engineer @ EasyMile
**Toulouse, France | Autonomous Vehicle Software**

At this pioneering French company, I honed my skills in writing **efficient, clean, and safety-critical software**. Key contributions included:
- Collision avoidance systems
- Trajectory monitoring
- Localization monitoring

This experience gave me deep insights into:
- The foundations of computer science
- Low-level programming (close to hardware)
- Safety-critical software development standards

**Total Experience:** 3+ years
